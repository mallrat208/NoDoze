# NoDoze
No Doze, the No Sleeping Mod for Minecraft Forge. There are versions for 1.10.2 and 1.11.2

No Doze removes the abiliy to sleep by setting the result of the PlayerSleepInBedEvent to "OTHER_PROBLEM"

Players are able to set their spawn by attempting to sleep. By default this can be done at any time during the day. There is a config option to restrict this to night time only.
