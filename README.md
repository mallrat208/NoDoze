# NoDoze
No Doze, the No Sleeping Mod for Minecraft Forge 1.10.2

No Doze removes the abiliy to sleep by setting the result of the PlayerSleepInBedEvent to "OTHER_PROBLEM"

Players are able to set their spawn by attempting to sleep. By default this can be done at any time during the day. There is a config option to restrict this to night time only.
